# Communicate Data Findings
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 5
Implementation of a exploratory and explanatory analysis of a Ford GoBike data set 

# Project Overview

Why this project?
Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.

*Exploratory* data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

*Explanatory* data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

This project has two major steps 
1. conduct an exploratory data analysis on the [FordGo Bike Data Set](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data&sa=D&ust=1554486256012000) data set
2. main findings from your exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis

## Performed Steps in this project 

* Explore the data: Feel free to explore the jupyter notebook where the dataset is visually, and programatically explored.
* Document the story: organized findings convey a story to present to an audience
* Communicate the findings - a slide deck with my findings is prepared for a curious audience.

## Files 
* exploration_template.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook contains section templates to help you organize your exploration, starting from loading in the data, working through univariate visualizations, and ending with bivariate and multivariate exploration.

* slide_deck_template.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook contains starter cells to help you organize your slide deck deliverable. These cells provide an example of how the slide deck should be organized, including pre-set slideshow settings.

To view the slide deck, you will need to use the expression (all one line): jupyter nbconvert Example_Project_Diamonds_Part2.ipynb --to slides --post serve --template output_toggle

output_toggle.tpl - This template file can be used with nbconvert to export your slide deck. This adds extra functionality to the slide deck by hiding the code to start, only making it visible if the reader clicks on the output (which should mostly be visualizations in the case of this project).

## Learnings

* Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
* Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
* Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
* Aplly the following libaries effectively: Seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, jupyterthemes, and datetime
